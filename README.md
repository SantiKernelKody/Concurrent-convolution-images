# Concurrent Convolution Project

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing operating system efficiency through concurrent convolution techniques. The goal is to implement and explore various concepts, such as threads, processes, multitasking, pointers, and scheduling, to enhance the performance of convolution operations in image processing tasks.

## Key Objectives

- Implement concurrent convolution algorithms.
- Explore the use of threads and processes for parallel execution.
- Investigate multitasking and scheduling strategies to maximize system resources.
- Leverage pointers and efficient memory management techniques.
- Measure and analyze the performance improvements achieved through these optimizations.
